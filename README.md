# The Art of Data Science

This repository represent the joint effort of [Paris Lodron University of Salzburg](https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=52) and the [City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy](http://sph.cuny.edu/) in creating an interactive online reading of Matsui and Peng's *The Art of Data Science*. In each of our weekly meetings, a chapter of the book is presented by a developing instructor with a focus on using the R language. Our meetings are open to all (see details below) and our materials are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License.
